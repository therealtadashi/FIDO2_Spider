# Problem with Dynamic Scraping

Common problems surrounding dynamic scraping:

- **Client Side Rendering** (need for manual interaction)
- **Crawl-Duration**
- **Large Website Size**: use **ETL** tools -> json, csv format -> store on Apache hadoop, Apache Spark
- **IP-bans**
- **Region Specific Websites**
- **Respecting Website Rules** (robots.txt)

# Dynamic Web Scraping Process to find WebAuthn Login

search the login pages from the url listed in **tranco**:

1. create common sub-URL pattern list to access login pages
   - for example: /login, /user, /auth, /signin, /account
2. get tranco list
3. access tranco csv
4. make csv iterable
   - **Parallelise CSV Access**: If working with very large CSVs, split the work across multiple threads to improve performance when scraping
5. iterate through the list
   - filter domains not accessible by TLS - secure connection
6. access robots.txt to respect sites rules
7. filter all disallowed url patterns from common sub-URL pattern list
8. scrape with the rest of the allowed patterns
9. Dynamic Discovery: Parse homepage HTML for links or redirects leading to a login page
10. search for WebAuthn
    - **API Interaction**: Instead of just searching for WebAuthn features passively, consider interacting with the siteâ€™s authentication mechanism by simulating a WebAuthn request to verify its presence.
    - **Improve Accuracy**: Look for additional WebAuthn indicators, like the presence of WebAuthn-specific polyfills or reliance on specific authentication services that support WebAuthn (e.g., Okta, Auth0).
